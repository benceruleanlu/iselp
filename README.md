# ISELP for Everyone

The idea behind this website was to provide a more digestable way to intake the information from the rather lengthly [ISELP Programming Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19JGCfusp80INEaoEr3Kflopd67AFguzkGtJh-I2Y7Lg/edit?usp=sharing) document.

Over weeks of planning, designing, and programming, the project was sculpted from the ground up. This was made possible by the vision and support from Mr. Lyle, a resource teacher, who led the project from start to finish.

The website was designed with Figma, then written in TypeScript with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

Thank you for reading about the story of this website, we hope it served you well.
