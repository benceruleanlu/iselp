                        <p>Accommodating learners engaged in ISELP differs somewhat from supporting students with other exceptionalities and/or needs. Allowing the learner the opportunity to engage in meaningful learning is critical in their development. This, of course, is true of all students. As such, this section describes how teachers can work to effectively accommodate these students in the classroom and with specific strategies.</p>
                        <p>Key takeaways for the classroom conditions and teacher programming to support learners engaged in ISELP include:</p>
                        <ol className='list-disc pl-12 space-y-1'>
                            <li>Class work for learners engaged in ISELP should be based on the curriculum with the aim of working toward greater depth and breadth of the concepts being taught. Assessment and evaluation should be based on the curricular expectations of the standard grade level curriculum and not based on extensions beyond the expected work of their peers.</li>
                            <li>While teachers may feel a need for acceleration with students engaged in ISELP, it often benefits students to work with the same concepts at a more sophisticated level without acceleration through the curriculum.</li>
                            <li>Opportunities for extensions of course work should be provided, based on student interest, but should be monitored to ensure that students are not overwhelmed with additional tasks to complete.</li>
                            <li>Additional opportunities should stay in line with the same time commitments as their classmates, by bypassing instances of learning when the student can demonstrate proficiency.</li>
                            <li>Activities should foster student agency in their learning and opportunities for self-directed learning.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Early in a given school year, it is advisable that the classroom teacher collaborate with the ISSP teacher to build a comprehensive student portrait, based on the input from the student, family/caregiver(s), and all educators, in order get a sense of what the student&rsquo;s strengths and preferences for extensions are to meet the accommodations set in their IEP.</p>

                            <p>Students with a Gifted identification should be evaluated based on the Ontario Curriculum as with any student in their grade. While Gifted students may be given opportunities to go beyond the course material and work on modified activities, all assessments should be evaluated based on standard grade level curricular expectations, as for all learners.</p>

                            <p>Many strategies may work differently within different subjects and will depend on the teacher and the student. Typically, extensions focus on the idea of developing various skills with students engaged in ISELP. Many of the practices focus on building critical thinking and analytical skills while helping students self-advocate and work towards collective and self-directed learning. Additionally, opportunities for extensions should work to foster the opportunity to explore subject expectations in greater depth and breadth.</p>

                                    <p>As with any identified student with an exceptionality, learners engaged in ISELP should be afforded support through your school&rsquo;s Special Education department. Their contact may be with an ISSP teacher, Guidance teacher, or other similar types of roles based on the way your school&rsquo;s support team is structured.</p>
                                    <p>Early in a given school year, it is advisable that the classroom teacher collaborate with the ISSP teacher to build a comprehensive student portrait, based on the input from the student, family/caregiver(s), and all educators, in order get a sense of what the student&rsquo;s strengths and preferences for extensions are to meet the accommodations set in their IEP.</p>
                                    <p>Below are some guiding topics that can build effective planning for students engaged in ISELP who are part of your classroom:</p>

                                        <li><i>Discuss what are the given strengths and needs for each student. What are some interests that the student may focus on (ex: Social - leadership opportunities; Cognitive - Engaging with a passion project which satisfies the curricular expectations) that you may be able to support.</i></li>
                                        <li><i>Ensure that any other exceptionalities (e.g., learning disabilities), diagnoses (e.g., ADHD, anxiety), and other areas that need to be supported (e.g., ELL) are discussed and how they impact the learner portrait, ensuring there is a comprehensive understanding of the student&rsquo;s complete portrait as a learner.</i></li>
                                        <li><i>Discuss what particular strategies work best with each student and what potential needs might students have in interacting with the class and teacher.</i></li>
                                        <li><i>Discuss the possible opportunities for cross-curricular work with other teachers in the same term or school year.</i></li>

                                    <p>Learners engaged in ISELP may show advanced mastery of subject material but may also not excel in the specific skills in each subject discipline, or may not exercise the necessary learning skills to ensure that they meet all grade-level curriculum expectations. Special Education identification is part of many intersecting identifications of our students. Students who are identified as Gifted can have deficiencies in other areas, such as social maturity, and other diagnosed learning disabilities.</p>
                                    <p>Students with a Gifted identification should be evaluated based on the Ontario Curriculum as with any student in their grade. While Gifted students may be given opportunities to go beyond the course material and work on modified activities, all assessments should be evaluated based on standard grade level curricular expectations, as for all learners.</p>

                                    <p>There are a variety of strategies and ongoing practices that help encourage learning for the Gifted student. Fullan (2014, p3) provides a very clear description of new pedagogies as &ldquo;the foundation of teacher quality is a teacher&rsquo;s pedagogical capacity - their repertoire of teaching strategies and their ability to form partnerships with students in mastering the process of learning. Technology in the new model is pervasive and it is used to discover and master content knowledge and to enable the deep learning goals of creating and using new knowledge in the world.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>Many strategies may work differently within different disciplines and may depend on the teacher and the student. The following chart highlights strategies and practices that focus on the idea of developing various skills with students engaged in ISELP. Many of the practices focus on building critical thinking and analytical skills while helping students self-advocate and work towards collective and self-directed learning. Additionally, these strategies should work to foster the opportunity to explore subject expectations in greater depth and breadth.</p>
