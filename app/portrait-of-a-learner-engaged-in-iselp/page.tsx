        <hr />

        <p>The Ministry of Education defines Giftedness as &ldquo;[a]n unusually advanced degree of general intellectual ability that requires differentiated learning experiences of a depth and breadth beyond those normally provided in the regular school program to satisfy the level of educational potential indicated&rdquo; (Ministry of Education, 2017). For the purposes of the Peel District School Board, this is the definition that is used to describe our Gifted learners.</p>
        <p>It is important to note the other definitions of Giftedness that cite characteristics such as:</p>

        <ol className='list-disc pl-12'>
          <li>&ldquo;asynchronous development&rdquo; (Vuyk, Kerr, & Thomas, 2016; Silverman, 1996);</li>
          <li>a &ldquo;physiological reality&rdquo; (Gifted Development Centre); and,</li>
          <li>exceptionally high ability regardless of academic performance (Peterson, 2015).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>However, Giftedness goes far beyond this definition, and like all exceptionalities, is complex. Common characteristics and traits of Gifted learners are listed below:</p>

        <p className='font-semibold text-xl'>Affective qualities of Gifted learners:</p>
        
        <p>Gifted learners often perceive and engage with the world differently than their non-Gifted peers. While many of their &lsquo;gifts&rsquo; present a multitude of opportunities, it is important to note that in some cases these &lsquo;gifts&rsquo; might make students more vulnerable to academic anxiety, social-emotional problems, and Gifted underachievement (Stornelli, Flett, & Hewitt, 2009; Christopher & Shewmaker, 2010;. Gaesser, 2018).</p>

        <p className='font-semibold text-xl'>Gifted underachievement:</p>

        <p>Some Gifted students underperform compared to the evidence that they are capable of high achievement. Research offers a variety of reasons to explain Gifted underachievement including, but not limited to:</p>

        <ol className='list-disc pl-12'>
          <li>students&rsquo; fixed mindset about giftedness such as perfectionism or rebellion;</li>
          <li>feeling unsupported by parents, teachers and/or non-Gifted peers; and,</li>
          <li>misperceptions about the value of student work such as varied interpretations of depth and breadth of learning (Rimm, 1986; Roberts, Inman & Robins, 2022).</li>

            <p className='font-semibold text-xl'>What is Giftedness?</p>

            <p>Giftedness is a complex exceptionality. As such, there are a variety of definitions that are used to describe &ldquo;Giftedness&rdquo; across a variety of resources. There is no universally accepted definition of gifted. Some definitions are functional and relate to a selection process (e.g., scores, percentiles) and some clarify the nature of giftedness (e.g., domains, affinities). The Ministry of Education&#39;s definition of Giftedness is: &ldquo;an unusually advanced degree of general intellectual ability that requires differentiated learning experiences of a depth and breadth beyond those normally provided.&rdquo; This is the definition under which the Peel District School Board and schools throughout the province use to determine &ldquo;Giftedness.&rdquo; </p>

            <p>However, it is important to note the other definitions of Giftedness that cite characteristics such as:</p>

            <ol className='list-disc pl-12'>
              <li>&ldquo;asynchronous development&rdquo; (Vuyk, Kerr, & Thomas, 2016; Silverman, 1996);</li>
              <li>a &ldquo;physiological reality&rdquo; (Gifted Development Centre); and,</li>
              <li>exceptionally high ability regardless of academic performance (Peterson, 2015).</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Vuky, Kerr, & Thomas (2016) present a definition of Giftedness that incorporates a wide swath of the research into Giftedness, defining it as &ldquo;asynchronous development in which advanced cognitive abilities and heightened intensity combine to create inner experiences and awareness that are qualitatively different from the norm&rdquo; (Vuyk, Kerr, & Thomas, 2016, pg. 60). Most importantly, though, as there are no two Gifted learners who are exactly alike, there is no single definition of Giftedness (Kennedy & Farley, 2017).</p>

            <p className='font-semibold text-xl'>Common characteristics of Gifted learners</p>

            <p>There is a common misconception that Gifted students are a fairly heterogeneous group (Schultz, 2018); however, Gifted students can exhibit a wide range of personality characteristics and processing abilities.</p>

            <p>The graphic below outlines those characteristics that appear most commonly in Gifted students, even though they will be expressed differently in each student. It is important to recognize that not every Gifted student will necessarily show all of the same characteristics or common traits.</p>

            <p className='font-semibold text-xl'>Misconceptions about Giftedness</p>

            <p>Due to the complex intellectual and socio-emotional traits of Gifted learners, it is not uncommon for educators to misunderstand their behaviours, attitudes, and learning needs or desires. As educators, it is important to understand these misconceptions and to understand the truths as they have direct implications on teaching practice and the ways in which Gifted students learn.</p>

            <p>Researchers acknowledge a number of misconceptions about Gifted students that are identified in the chart below, along with considerations for teaching practice.</p>
