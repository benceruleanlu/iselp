It assists teachers to focus and to program for the studen&rsquo;s strengths, consider ways of motivating the student and supporting their learning by drawing on strengths that the student has demonstrated in other subjects. It is also essential to acknowledge all other needs, identifications, or diagnoses (e.g., social-emotional, ELL, etc.), highlight prior knowledge in various subjects, learning style or preference, and interests outside school.

              <p>The learning process for students engaged in ISELP requires planning supports that will motivate and engage in order to further enhance the learning experience. As such, programming for these learners is instrumental to developing their fullest potential and to support growth. Developing the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is the first step for schools to identify the learner&rsquo;s needs and to maximize the learner&rsquo;s abilities.</p>
              <p>Researchers have identified that Gifted students require a faster pace, work that is appropriately challenging, and the opportunity to engage in tasks that do not have a straightforward solution (Gomez-Arizaga et al, 2020). Students engaged in ISELP will not simply gain benefit from exploring a curriculum that is new to them. The greater cognitive skills demonstrated by these students will create ongoing demands on the need to provide programming suitable to their needs as a learner.</p>

                  <p>Students may not demonstrate the same degree of advancement in all subject areas and their abilities may develop asynchronously. This also means that these students may be able to understand complex ideas they are not developmentally or emotionally ready for which can be a cause of anxiety.</p>
                  <p>It is reasonable to assume that some students may require accommodations, built into their IEP, as a means of providing an additional level of support and ISELP programming.</p>
                  <p>Students who are engaged in ISELP may also present with other identified (and sometimes not identified) exceptionalities. When developing an IEP for these students, the needs of all of these areas must be taken into account.</p>
                <p className="font-semibold" id='the-gifted-plan-enhanced-learning-plan'>The Gifted Plan/Enhanced Learning Plan</p>
                  <p>Annual Goals within the Gifted or Enhanced Learning Plan should be broad to allow students to focus on a skill they can develop throughout the curriculum in all subject areas.</p>
                  <p>The student&rsquo;s work toward the goals outlined in the Gifted/Enhanced Learning Plan should be primarily completed as part of their work in the classroom. Opportunities for withdrawal can also be included as part of the student&rsquo;s ISELP work to complement the programming in the Gifted/Enhanced Learning Plan; however, the majority of the work toward ISELP goals should be part of the teaching and learning process in the student&rsquo;s main classroom. To put it simply, students who require ISELP support need it on an ongoing basis, not for discrete blocks of time throughout the week.</p>
                  <p>Students engaged in ISELP are most successful when they view their goals as meaningful, valuable, and relevant. It is important that the goals are individualized to the student, and created collaboratively with the student, the family/caregiver(s), and the teaching staff that work with the student.</p>

                  <p>As with any student with an Individual Education Plan (IEP), Students who are part of ISELP require changes in the process of learning (through differentiation, accommodations, and alternative programming, including a Gifted/Enhanced Learning Plan, as appropriate - see Figure 1, below) to maintain motivation and engagement in that learning. Giftedness should be addressed in the subjects of greatest interest or strength (Ministry of Education). This programming is not limited to the core subject areas, but can be applied to any area that matches the student&rsquo;s portrait.</p>
                  <p>Researchers have identified that Gifted students require a faster pace, work that is appropriately challenging, and the opportunity to engage in tasks that do not have a straightforward solution (Gomez-Arizaga et al, 2020).

                  <p>ABC Ontario (2008) suggests two criteria for determining what changes to the learning process should be implemented via the student&rsquo;s IEP:</p>
                  <ol className='list-decimal pl-12'>
                    <li>All stakeholders (the student, the family/caregiver(s), the educators involved with the student, etc.) should share an understanding of the programming and be held accountable for its implementation. The IEP should clearly state the unique learning expectations for the student and how to implement them.</li>
                    <li>Learning experiences that are enriched should be described with enough detail that subsequent teachers, and those in other subject areas, would know where to begin with the programming in their classes. The programming needs to be tracked with sufficient detail so as to avoid unnecessary repetition.</li> 
                  </ol>

                <p className="font-semibold text-xl" id='differentiation-and-program-development'>Differentiation and program development</p>
                  <p>In order to maximize success, students engaged in ISELP frequently require an individualized program that differs in content, processes, teaching and learning strategies, and evaluation methods. The ISELP Individual Education Plan is the starting point and the accommodations and alternative skills listed on the <a href='https://iep.peelschools.org/eLite/iepdocuments//DOCUMENTATION/MENU/EFFECTIVE/8%20-%20DEVELOPING%20GIFTED%20PLAN%20.PDF' target='_blank' className='text-[#0066CC] underline'>Gifted (for Identified students) or Enhanced Learning Plan (for Non-Identified students) page</a> are an essential part of the programming to meet the needs of the student.</p>
                  <p>The IEP can be tailored to the needs of the student engaged in ISELP to:</p>
                  <ol className='list-disc pl-12'>
                    <li>develop an alternative skills Gifted or Enhanced Learning Plan page that outlines programming related to curricular areas</li>
                    <li>provide instructional, environmental, and assessment accommodations matched to the learning needs of the student</li>
                    <li>develop transition planning goals and actions that are matched to the student&rsquo;s needs and aspirations (short, medium, and long-term goals)</li>
                    <li>develop other alternative skills pages to further outline and provide programming for skills development in other non-curricular areas (e.g., social skills, learning skills, etc.)</li>

                  <p>A variety of tools can be helpful during this consultation process, in order to develop a comprehensive picture of the student&rsquo;s learning portrait, their goals, and other underlying factors that may require attention during the IEP development process.

                <p className="font-semibold text-xl" id='accomodations-as-part-of-the-ISELP-IEP-1'>Accommodations as part of the ISELP IEP</p>
                  <p>Students may not demonstrate the same degree of advancement in all subject areas and their abilities may develop asynchronously. This also means that these students may be able to understand complex ideas they are not developmentally or emotionally ready for which can be a cause of anxiety (e.g., death anxiety). Additionally, overexcitabilities are more common in the Gifted population (Silverman, 2016; Gassear, 2018); therefore it is reasonable to assume that some students may require accommodations, built into their IEP, as a means of providing an additional level of support and ISELP programming.</p>
                  <p>Students who are engaged in ISELP may also present with other identified (and sometimes not identified) exceptionalities. When developing an IEP for these students, the needs of all of these areas must be taken into account.</p>
                  <p className='font-semibold'>Accomodations Examples</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;The goal of applying interventions and making accommodations is to enable the student to learn successfully...The needs of the individual student, the resources available, and parent and student preferences must all be considered in determining the nature and extent of the interventions and accommodations recommended and provided.&rdquo; (<a href='https://files.ontario.ca/edu-special-education-policy-resource-guide-en-2022-05-30.pdf' target='_blank' className='text-[#0066CC] underline'>Special Education in Ontario, Kindergarten to Grade 12: Policy and Resource Guide</a>, C25). The following sections provide examples of possible accommodations that can be included within the student&rsquo;s IEP.</p>
                
                <p className="font-semibold text-xl" id='alternative-skills-pages'>Alternative skills pages</p>
                  <p>Per the <a href='http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/policy/os/onschools_2017e.pdf' target='_blank' className='text-[#0066CC] underline'>Special Education in Ontario</a> guide, Alternative Skills can be recorded in the IEP in order to develop programming to complement the curricular learning. These skill areas should be designed to provide an appropriate level of challenge for the student to develop their cognitive skills, and should be achievable (in terms of mastery) with reasonable effort on the student&rsquo;s part.</p>
                  <p className='font-semibold'>Learning goal orientation</p>
                    <p>Kulkin (2016) describes the difference between the two learning goal orientations: performance and mastery. &ldquo;Performance goals are often met in a climate of competition that prizes speed, memorization of facts, and acquisition of specific skills. In contrast, mastery goals emphasize real-world application and problem solving&rdquo; (p.29). Mastery goals are connected to intrinsic motivation, academic efficacy, persistence, help-seeking behaviour, and is negatively correlated to test anxiety (Furner & Gonzalez-DeHass, 2011, p. 231). </p>
                    <ol className='list-decimal pl-12'>
                      <li><p className='pb-2'>Performance Goals:</p>
                        <ol className='list-disc pl-12 space-y-1'>
                          <li>What Students Focus On: Students with performance goals care a lot about their grades and proving their abilities. They are focused on academic performance.</li>
                          <li>How They Approach Learning: They focus on real-world application and problem-solving. Mastery-focused learning emphasizes developing healthy learning habits, such as asking questions and seeking support when needed.</li>
                          <li>Impact: This approach reduces anxiety because they seek help and understand their mistakes.</li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                      <li><p className='pb-2 pt-4'>Mastery Goals:</p>
                        <ol className='list-disc pl-12 space-y-1'>
                          <li>What Students Focus On: Students with mastery goals are more interested in learning and improving their skills. They are more willing to investigate mistakes and understand their errors.</li>
                          <li>How They Approach Learning: They focus on real-world application and problem-solving. Mastery-focused learning emphasizes developing healthy learning habits, such as asking questions and seeking support when needed.</li>
                          <li>Impact: This approach reduces anxiety because they seek help and understand their mistakes.</li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                  <p>In a mastery classroom, students should feel comfortable to ask questions and view questioning as evidence of a strong learner. Students are encouraged to use their peers as &ldquo;helpful resources in the pursuit of learning&rdquo; (Furner & Gonzalez-DeHass, 2011, p.237). </p>
                  <p>In a mastery classroom environment, there is a heavy focus on the process of learning, students&rsquo; feelings towards learning are important, and evaluation is a private critique of the work rather than a confirmation of a student&rsquo;s ability.</p>
