            <p>Each section provides two options for readers:</p>
            <ol className='list-decimal pl-12'>
              <li>A <span className='italic'>highlights and summary</span> section that reviews the basic level of information about that topic.</li>
              <li>An <span className='italic'>in-depth</span> section that goes into significantly more detail about that topic.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This resource is designed to be used by classroom teachers, ISSP teachers, administrators, SERTs, and anyone else involved in supporting students engaged in ISELP.</p>
            <p>Supporting both Gifted learners and learners who receive non-identified ISELP programming throughout their school career is critical to them achieving optimal success. It is equally critical to create the appropriate learning environment that will allow each learner to thrive, build upon their strengths, and hone their interests. As stated in <a href='http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/inclusiveguide.pdf' target='_blank' className='italic text-[#0066CC] underline'>Equity and Inclusive Education in Ontario Schools</a>, “Schools are expected to support effective instructional practices that reflect the diverse needs and pathways of all students” (p. 21). The intent of this guide is to do just that for learners engaged in ISELP programming. Each section of this resource is intended to address the various aspects that are required to effectively support and understand the student engaged in ISELP. For the educator who may be new to working with the learner engaged in ISELP, it is recommended that this resource be viewed in its entirety. Alternatively it can be accessed in sections, based on the specific information required of the reader.</p>
            <p>Additionally, throughout each section of this resource, there are numerous links to other resources to explore that will enhance understanding on how to support students engaged in ISELP.</p>
