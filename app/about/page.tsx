            <p>The idea behind this website was to provide a more digestable way to intake the information from the rather lengthly <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/19JGCfusp80INEaoEr3Kflopd67AFguzkGtJh-I2Y7Lg/edit?usp=sharing' target='_blank' className='text-[#0066CC] underline'>ISELP Programming Guide</a> document.</p>
            <p>Over weeks of planning, designing, and programming, the project was sculpted from the ground up. This was made possible by the vision and support from Mr. Lyle, a resource teacher, who led the project from start to finish.</p>
            <p>The website was designed with Figma, then written in TypeScript with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. You can view the source code on the <a href='https://github.com/benceruleanlu/iselp' target='_blank' className='text-[#0066CC] underline'>GitHub repository</a>.</p>
            <p>Thank you for reading about the story of this website, we hope it served you well.</p>
